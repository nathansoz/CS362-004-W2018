Title: Village function reduces the number of actions player can take by 1. It should increase by 2
Classification: Serious Bug - Card does not conform to official rules
Platform: Ubuntu 16.04
Repos: Every Time
Description:

The village card always DECREASES the number of actions the player can take instead of increasing it by 2.

You can trigger this by calling cardEffect for village.

I would expect my actions to increase by 2.


Steps-To-Reproduce:

Consider the following code, compiled with: gcc -o test -g  test.c dominion.o rngs.o -Wall -fpic -coverage -lm 

#include "dominion.h"
#include "dominion_helpers.h"
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include "rngs.h"

int repro()
{
    int p;
    int c;
    int bonus;
    int failed = 0;
    int numPlayer = 4;
    int maxCards = 5;
    int seed = 1000;
    int k[10] = {adventurer, council_room, feast, gardens, mine
            , remodel, smithy, village, baron, great_hall};

    struct gameState G;
    memset(&G, 23, sizeof(struct gameState));   // clear the game state
    int r = initializeGame(numPlayer, k, seed, &G);

    int numActions = G.numActions;
    int numCards = G.handCount[0];
    printf ("TESTING CARD village:\n");
    cardEffect(village, 0, 0, 0, &G, 7, &bonus);
    int newNumActions = G.numActions;
    int newNumCards = G.handCount[0];

    if(newNumActions == numActions + 2)
    {
        printf("PASSED: Number of actions is %i; Expected %i\n", newNumActions, numActions + 2);
        return 0;
    }
    else
    {
        printf("FAILED: Number of actions is %i; Expected %i\n", newNumActions, numActions + 2);
        return 1;
    }
}

Workaround: NONE
